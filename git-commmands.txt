//git clone vs git pull
git clone is used for just downloading exactly what is currently working on the remote server repository and saving it in your machine's folder where that project is placed. Mostly it is used only when we are going to upload the project for the first time. After that pull is the better option.

git pull is a (clone(download) + merge) operation and mostly used when you are working as teamwork. In other words, when you want the recent changes in that project, you can pull.

The clone will setup additional remote-tracking branches.
git pull:

    git init

    git remote add origin git://github.com/chandra/repo.git

    git fetch --all

    git pull origin master

git clone:

	git clone git://github.com/chandra/repo.git
