# Code-Templates

Created this repo for understanding the concpets of git and github.  
Notes:  

A repo can be cloned, updated and then pushed to github.  

An existing directory on local machine,
1. can be initialized as a git repo using git init
2. files can be added using git add (git add . to add all files)
3. added files can be committed using git commit (-a to add and commit all existing files)
4. create a repo on github
5. create a remote on your local machine using git remote add
6. push all your changes using git_push

git-commands.txt file consists of all the bash commands for git.
The other two cpp scripts are my templates for competitive coding.
